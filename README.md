# The JSON Project
The JSON Project makes it easier for developers to find .JSON files to integrate into their personal projects. I made this project because the .JSON files I used for data kept getting deleted because the sites kept going down. This Project will go down only if GitHub Pages go down or my account gets banned.

## Contribute to the Project
Contribute to this open source project by adding .JSON data.
